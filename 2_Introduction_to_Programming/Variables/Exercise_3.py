print('''
index is non-idiomatic because it is not capitalized.
CatName is non-idiomatic because it contains lower-case letters.
snake_case is non-idiomatic because it contains lower-case letters.
LAZY_DOG3 is idiomatic.
1ST is illegal because it starts with a number.
operand2 is non-idiomatic becuase it contains lower-case letters.
BIG_NUMBER is idiomatic.
I don't know what Π is but I think it's non-idiomatic because it
      isn't an ASCII character?
