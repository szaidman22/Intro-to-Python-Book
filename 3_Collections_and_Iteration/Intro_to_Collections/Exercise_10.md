Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

```python
names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)
```

Sets are not ordered, so we can't know what order the names will print out.
