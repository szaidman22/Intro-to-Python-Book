In your own words, explain the difference between these two expressions.

```python
my_object1 == my_object2
my_object1 is my_object2
```
Expression 1 asks if the first and second variables are *equal*, meaning, do the objects they point to have the same value.

Expression 2 asks if the first and second variables point to the *same* object, meaning, do they both point to the same location in memory.
